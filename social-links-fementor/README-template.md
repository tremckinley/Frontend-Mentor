## Overview

### The challenge
This design was completed using my working frontend knowledge along with the provided style guide and Figma file.
Part of the challenge was to meet both the functional and style requirement given to be through the design files.

Users should be able to:
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

The challenge I gave myself for this lesson was to put my React skills to the test out of learning modules. This challenge could have been completed using HTML and CSS, but my goal is to build my JavaScript skills on the frontend.
My challenge began with step 1, initiating a working React app using Next.js. To to this, I read the documentation, reached out to friends for the best tools to learn with and committed to configuring a live site on my local server.
My final challenge came at the end when it was time to deploy the site to the web. Again, I took an example from a friend and decided on Vercel over GitHub pages and Surge, both of which I've used in the past for static pages. 

The coding challenge for me here was using a mix of vanilla CSS and Tailwind CSS in a way that looked clean. I took some high-leve styles and placed them in a CSS file, while some of the more fine-tuned spacing was done using Tailwind.

```
p {
    font-size: 12px;
} 
/* name */
h1 {
    font-size: 17px;
    font-weight: bold;
}
/* location */
h3 {
    font-size: 14px;
    padding: 2px;
    color:rgb(197 248 42 / 90%);
    font-weight: 600;
}
```

Most importantly, I was able to practice working off of a Figma file, which is a necessary skill for frontend builders.

### Continued development

I will continue building my understanding of the Next.js app structure and how to more properly mix Tailwind and vanilla CSS. I put a lot of time into figuring out how to mix the two here for this static site, but want to use a more conventional means on more complicated projects.

### Useful resources

- [Next deployment instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) - Reading this documentation got me started. Understanding how to read documentation and learn of the fly is important in any tech-facing career. You can do it, face the challenge!

Thanks to Rob Crocker for the encouragement and assistance on this one! If not for the added motivation of sharing my work, I likely would have done just another HTML/CSS until I felt more "comfortable". Instead, I'm fired up! ðŸ”¥
